 Parking Management System

Overview
The Parking Management System is a software application designed to manage and streamline the parking process in a parking facility. It provides an efficient way to allocate parking slots for different types of vehicles, calculate parking fees, generate receipts, and track parking status and earnings.

Features
Parking Slot Allocation: The system offers dedicated parking slots for buses, cars, bikes, and autos. Each vehicle type is allocated a specific number of slots based on demand and capacity.
Fee Calculation: Parking fees are calculated based on the type of vehicle and the duration of parking. Different rates are applied for buses, cars, bikes, and autos.
Receipt Generation: Upon parking a vehicle, the system generates a receipt containing essential details such as the owner's name, vehicle number, parking date, and parking fee. This receipt serves as proof of payment and provides transparency in the parking process.
Parking Status Checking: Users can check the current parking status to see the availability of parking slots for each vehicle type. This feature helps users make informed decisions before entering the parking facility.
Earnings Tracking: The system keeps track of the total earnings generated from parking fees. This information is useful for financial reporting and analysis, as well as for optimizing revenue generation strategies.
Implementation
The Parking Management System is implemented as a command-line application in C++. It utilizes object-oriented programming principles to create classes and methods for handling various parking operations such as vehicle parking, fee calculation, receipt generation, and parking status checking.

The system maintains separate variables to track the number of available parking slots for buses, cars, bikes, and autos. It also keeps a record of the total earnings generated from parking fees.

Usage
To use the Parking Management System, users interact with a simple menu-driven interface presented in the terminal or command prompt. They can perform actions such as parking vehicles, checking parking status, and exiting the program by selecting options from the menu.

Future Enhancements
Possible enhancements to the Parking Management System include:

Integration with a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
Support for additional features such as parking slot reservation and online payment options.
Implementation of advanced algorithms for optimizing parking slot allocation and fee calculation based on real-time data.
Conclusion
The Parking Management System provides an efficient and convenient solution for managing parking facilities, ensuring smooth operations, and enhancing user experience. With its robust features and potential for future enhancements, it serves as a valuable tool for parking administrators and facility managers.
